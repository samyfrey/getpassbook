## User Stories

As a user, I want to understand the main features of the passbook application, be able to request more information through a contact form, and have a smooth experience scrolling through the page. 

## Technologies

Single page website 
- React JS 
- React-styled components
- emailJS (for contact form)
- React scroll (for menu and scroll to top)
- Recharts

## Purpose & Challenges

In this project, I focus on user interface and styling. I combine the use of css and styled components to avoid class name bugs and overlaps. 
Making sure the site was responsive while working with styled components was the most challenging part given the absence of class names when debugging with the dev tool console.
